# CARGO Application
We've crafted a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for the CARGO app, aimed at aiding individuals in finding their ideal car. Recognizing the challenge many face in discovering cars with desired features, we developed an app to simplify this process. Users can design their dream car, locate similar options nearby, and request personalized designs from local agencies. To ensure we met user expectations, we engaged in discussions with eight individuals and conducted a survey involving 41 participants across various age groups, shaping an app tailored to their needs.
